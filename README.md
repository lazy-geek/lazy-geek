Hi my name is Abrar, i go by as lazy-geek on github.

I Am A Self-Tought Developer And I Love To Contribute To Open-source,
I Was Introduced To Computers Through My Intrests in Electronics And How They Work.

I Try To Play Around And Learn Diffrent Technologies And Languages Whenever I Get A Chance

My First Programming Language Was Javascript Which I Learned In My Free Time Few Years Ago, Ever Since Then I Have Never Looked Back.

My GitHub UserName Is lazy-geek Because As You Can Guess From UserName, I Am lazy, Particularly At Doing Repetitve Tasks. That's Another Reason I Love Computers Because You Can Automate Repetitve Tasks, And I Would Rather Spend 1 Hour Automating That Task Than Spend 30 Minute Actually Doing The Task Because I Learn New Things That Way.

## Languages And Tools:
